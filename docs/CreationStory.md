# Creation of this Boilerplate

When creating this boilerplate, this is the process I used.

* [Create React App](#createreactapp)

## Create React App

Using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), build a
new application.

```sh
create-react-app boilerplate-react-app
```

In order to add the features further down this page, I need full control over my
configuration choices. While [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
gets me off the ground very quickly, the fact that it obscures the
configurations makes it harder to add customizations.

I can eject by running

```sh
npm run eject
```
